Insurance Prediction Model ðŸš€
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict insurance outcomes based on user demographics and claim history. The model is powered by Gradient Boosting, achieving 85% accuracy and providing key insights into significant predictors for data-driven decision-making.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared a dataset with over 10,000 records, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
Modeling: Utilized Gradient Boosting to outperform the baseline by 15% in predictive accuracy.
Insights: Identified critical predictors such as age, income, and claim history to enhance business strategies.
