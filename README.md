# Insurance Prediction Model ðŸš€

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict insurance outcomes based on user demographics and claim history. The model is powered by **Gradient Boosting**, achieving **85% accuracy** and providing key insights into significant predictors for data-driven decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared a dataset with over **10,000 records**, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
- **Modeling:** Utilized Gradient Boosting to outperform the baseline by **15%** in predictive accuracy.
- **Insights:** Identified critical predictors such as **age, income, and claim history** to enhance business strategies.
